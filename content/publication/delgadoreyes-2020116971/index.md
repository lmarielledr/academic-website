abstract: Visual working memory (VWM) is a central cognitive system used to compare
  views of the world and detect changes in the local environment. This system undergoes
  dramatic development in the first two years; however, we know relatively little
  about the functional organization of VWM at the level of the brain. Here, we used
  image-based functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to test four hypotheses
  about the spatial organization of the VWM network in early development. Four-month-olds,
  1-year-olds, and 2-year-olds completed a VWM task while we recorded neural activity
  from 19 cortical regions-of-interest identified from a meta-analysis of the adult
  fMRI literature on VWM. Results showed significant task-specific functional activation
  near 6 of 19 ROIs, revealing spatial consistency in the brain regions activated
  in our study and brain regions identified to be part of the VWM network in adult
  fMRI studies. Working memory related activation was centered on bilateral anterior
  intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and left ventral
  occipital complex (VOC), while visual exploratory measures were associated with
  activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left TPJ, and bilateral IPS.
  Results show that a distributed brain network underlies functional changes in VWM
  in infancy, revealing new insights into the neural mechanisms that support infantsâ€™
  improved ability to remember visual information and to detect changes in an on-going
  visual stream.
