abstract: 'Abstract There is a growing need to understand the global impact of poverty
  on early brain and behavioural development, particularly with regard to key cognitive
  processes that emerge in early development. Although the impact of adversity on
  brain development can trap children in an intergenerational cycle of poverty, the
  massive potential for brain plasticity is also a source of hope: reliable, accessible,
  culturally agnostic methods to assess early brain development in low resource settings
  might be used to measure the impact of early adversity, identify infants for timely
  intervention and guide the development and monitor the effectiveness of early interventions.
  Visual working memory (VWM) is an early marker of cognitive capacity that has been
  assessed reliably in early infancy and is predictive of later academic achievement
  in Western countries. Here, we localized the functional brain networks that underlie
  VWM in early development in rural India using a portable neuroimaging system, and
  we assessed the impact of adversity on these brain networks. We recorded functional
  brain activity as young children aged 4–48 months performed a VWM task. Brain imaging
  results revealed localized activation in the frontal cortex, replicating findings
  from a Midwestern US sample. Critically, children from families with low maternal
  education and income showed weaker brain activity and poorer distractor suppression
  in canonical working memory areas in the left frontal cortex. Implications of this
  work are far-reaching: it is now cost-effective to localize functional brain networks
  in early development in low-resource settings, paving the way for novel intervention
  and assessment methods.'
